# Determining-Three-dimensional-structure-of-proteins
Finding 3  dimensional structure of proteins is one of the hot topics over the last several decades. It is a significant task since we can compare and contrast similar or different properties of biomolecules directly looking at their topology. Proteins have four different types of structures which are primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Primary is just a string of amino acids and the other three are 3D structures. There have been many researches that tried to find the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins, and most of them firstly attempted to find secondary structure firstly. and after tertiary structure since they are built serialy. In this research, the tertiary structure of proteins is tried to be predicted in a novel way. Alpha carbons in each amino acid are considered at the center of amino acids, and vectors and plane angles are calculated between these consecutive alpha carbons in each amino acid to determine the tertiary structure.
